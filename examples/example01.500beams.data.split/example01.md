As data split into smaller CSV files, hope less computer memory is needed. 

In this example, trajectories of laser beams striking on point A of a spherical segment (made of glass with index of refraction n=1.5) will be drawn by using Tikz. The radius of the whole sphere is r=8 cm, the distance from the striking point A to point B is a=3 cm. The angle ABD is 90 degrees. The distance from center C to the bottom side of the spherical segment is b=3 cm. The angle CFD is also 90 degrees. For incident angles being 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, and 53 degrees respectively, for examples, the refracted, then reflected, and further refracted beams are also drawn. All computations are done with the FORTRAN language.
